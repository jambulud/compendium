= Angular design

== Introduction
MyThaiStar client side has been built using latest frameworks, component libraries and designs:

*Angular* _4_ as main front-end Framework. https://angular.io/

*Angular/CLI* _1.0.5_ as Angular tool helper. https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

*Covalent Teradata* _1.0.0-beta4_ as Angular native component library based on Material Design. https://teradata.github.io/covalent/#/

*Angular/Material2* _1.0.0-beta5_ used by Covalent Teradata. https://github.com/angular/material2

_Note: this dependencies are evolving at this moment and if it is possible, we are updating it on the project._

== Basic project structure

The project is using the basic project seed that Angular/CLI provides with “ng new <project name>”. Then the app folder has been organized as Angular recommends and goes as follows:

* app
** components
*** sub-components
*** shared
*** component files
** main app component
* assets folder
* environments folder
* rest of angular files

This structure can be shown in the following example image:

== Main Views and components
List of components that serve as a main view to navigate or components developed to make atomically a group of functionalities which given their nature, can be highly reusable through the app.

_Note: no-name-route corresponds to whatever URL the user introduced and does not exist, it redirects to HomeComponent._

=== Public area
==== AppComponent
Contains the components that are on top of all views, including:

===== Order sidenav
Sidenav where selected orders are displayed with their total price and some comments.
